# To-Do List Web Application

**Department of Software Engineering**  
**Course: Software Configuration Management (SCM)**  
**Mini Project Assignment**  
**Team Size:** 6 students  
**Academic Year:** 5th

## Project Overview

This is a simple **To-Do List** web application developed as part of the SCM course requirements.  
The main focus of this project is the disciplined application of **Software Configuration Management** practices using Git/GitHub, including:

- SCM Plan (SCMP)
- Configuration Item identification and registration
- Version control with branching and pull requests
- Formal change control process (Change Requests)
- Baseline management (BL1 & BL2)
- Release management (v1.0 & v1.1)
- Configuration audits (PCA & FCA)

## Features

- User login/authentication page (basic username/password validation)
- Main dashboard displaying a list of tasks
- Core functionality: Add a new task
- Data persistence using a JSON file (`tasks.json`)

> **Note:** This is a minimal prototype intentionally kept simple to emphasize SCM processes over advanced functionality.
